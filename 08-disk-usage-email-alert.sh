#1. disaply all file systems
#2. show the usage in numbers without %, so that we can easily compare.
#3. sort out which is consuming and above threshold

#Commands explanation:
# echo -e "Message: \n$MESSAGE" ==> -e --> Enables interpretation of backslash escapes in the echo command
# awk -F " " '{print $6}'  --> -F - is field separator, $6 is the 6th column from the output.
# $NF - nth column or the last column
# cut -d "%" -f1  --> -d is delimeter, We are removing the % from the output from the field 1.
# example if output is 32%, then after cut command it is just 32 only.
# IFS = Internal Field Separator
# -r: Prevents backslash escapes from being interpreted. Useful when reading file paths or lines that may contain backslashes.
# line: The variable where the read line is stored.
# done <<< $DISK_USAGE    --> The command output of variable $disk_usage will be injected to while loop as an input.
